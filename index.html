      Hi! I'm Malcolm Ocean. Recently I got married and friends started asking me for advice on courtship. In those conversations, I found myself not only sharing personal experiences, but also applying insights from my years of research on how to develop <a class="blacklink" target="_blank" href="https://malcolmocean.com/2021/09/non-naive-trust-dance-why-the-name/">non-naive trust</a>. I want to help more people fall sanely in love, so I'm developing this online course on the patterns I've noticed.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.3em">You've done enough “dating indefinitely” and want to get real about courting.</p>

    <h3>Who is this <u>obviously</u> for?</h3>
      <p><strong>Your current situation:</strong> you have a person with whom there’s some mutual attraction and sense of romantic possibility. You might have just met last week, or you might be years in and talking about getting married, or you might be anywhere in between.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Your desired situation:</strong> stably mated for life. Some of what I have to say applies to a wide variety of life paths (some even applies outside of romance!) but my intended audience is someone who is potentially excited to get married and/or have kids—given the right person to do it with.</p>

      <p><strong>Your conundrum:</strong> is this the right person? How can I tell? Are we moving too fast? Are we hesitating because of some generic fear of commitment or because there’s something we can sense isn’t a fit? Can we resolve this conflict or will it follow us forever?</p>
      
      <p>These kinds of questions are what this course will help you learn to answer for yourself. <span class="unwrap">I don’t</span> have the answers—I have an approach for finding your own answers and helping your partner find theirs.</p>
    
    <h3>Who is this <u>maybe</u> for?</h3>
      <p>If you don’t have a current candidate person to fall in love with, but you broadly feel like you could meet that person and connect with them any day, and then you’d fit the description above, then come on in! Getting more clear on the process of falling in love (and/or on what happened in your last relationship) might help you clarify who you’re looking for as well.</p>

      <p>If you are married or have kids, but you feel conflicted or a sense of doom, or you resonate with the above conundrum paragraph, it might still be relevant. It’s… a lot more complicated, especially if there are kids. But I can probably help you get clarity!</p>

    <h3>Who is this <u>not</u> for?</h3>
      <p>If you can’t figure out how to get any mutual attraction with someone you'd plausibly want to court, you have a different challenge that this course does not address. Good luck!</p>
      
      <p>If you already have a life mate and it feels simple and stable and delightful, you’re good. But <a href="https://twitter.com/Malcolm_Ocean">reach out</a>&mdash;I’d love to interview you about what your process was like!</p>

      <p>If you're not interested in a life partnership, or not anytime soon, then stay away&mdash;this course is designed to help you get one.</p>

    <h2>What’s in the Mating Dance course :</h2>
    
    <h3>How does falling in love work?</h3>
      <p>There’s a mysterious process that, when it completes, results in two people looking at each other and having a vivid shared sense of “you are my life mate” (and the shared future that implies for the two of you in particular, such as kids). I call this process a “mating dance”.</p>
      
      <p>Each person needs different steps to complete in order for this to happen, and you don’t get to know them all in advance. But you can feel what matters to you, and there are signs you can look for at any given moment to tell if you’re dancing well or if you’re skipping steps or stepping on each others’ feet.</p>

      <p>I want to help you notice your innate sense of how the dance is going, and to listen to that and refine it, so you can dance gracefully in each moment, which will move you surely towards discovering “you are obviously my life mate” <em>if that’s possible</em>. And if it’s not possible, it will move you surely towards discovering <em>that</em>.</p>

    <h3>What makes marriage thrive?</h3>
      <p>Marriage, at its best, is a deep and unshakable foundation for the rest of life. And yet... <strong>divorce rates are high</strong> (not to mention rates of "in misery together"). Is this because people have attachment wounds, or lack communication skill? Or due to some general inability to see through commitments? In some cases, perhaps.</p>
      
      <p>But it seems to me that in many cases a deeper cause is that people commit to each other due to social pressure or fear&mdash;of rejection, loneliness, being a bad person&mdash;despite not experiencing that clear, obvious, unconflicted “you are my life mate” sense together. Whatever degree of intimacy and clarity they long for in a life partnership, they didn't thoroughly achieve before committing.</p>
      
      <p>There's another option. By mating dancing thoroughly and getting to that sense, you can steer clear of two problems:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Being committed to someone who, deep down, you don't want to be with.</strong> <span class="unwrap">In this scenario,</span> knowing what you want and communicating successfully are at odds with keeping the relationship alive. This means that while you're trying to keep the relationship alive, you'll need to systematically undermine your ability to do those things.</li>
        <li><strong>Being with someone you ultimately <em>could</em> want, but you aren't sure you do.</strong> <span class="unwrap">This situation</span> isn't as dire, but the hard part is that in the moment, you can't really tell the difference between it and the previous one! Locally they feel the same. And if you can't tell, then it's just as undermining of the sense of your marriage being a trusty foundation.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Both of these are foundational issues that can only somewhat be solved by trying harder and communicating better. For how to navigate marital challenges, I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/4aPcCCe" target="_blank">Passionate Marriage by David Schnarch</a>. It talks about how to communicate what you need while acknowledging that the fate of the relationship depends on being able to resolve what's present for you, <em>without</em> making that into a threat. And even the healthiest marriages need this skill, because as you grow and change and learn, there will be conflicts to resolve.</p>

      <p>But wouldn't you rather lay a solid foundation in the first place and not find yourself going uphill for years or decades straining to make it work with someone you never really got in sync with in the first place? That's what this course is for: to give you the tools to navigate towards <strong>“you are obviously my life mate.”</strong></p>

    <h3>The format of the Mating Dance course</h3>
      <p>This is a first iteration, so we’re doing it live! I’ve coached various friends and clients through clarifying their mating dances, as individuals and as couples, and I’m going to be doing something similar here. We’ll have four weekly 2h zoom calls where I’ll rotate through different course participants, addressing your situations live on the call, helping you learn to listen to your mating dance sense. Witnessing other participants getting coached can also give you insight into your own mating dance.</p>
      
      <p>I'll make recorded videos out of the calls, excerpts of which will be edited to become part of a library for a self-paced course I’ll create in the future. By signing up for this course, you’ll have lifetime access to any such course as well. (Although you won’t need mating dance advice forever!)</p>

      <p><strong>When exactly:</strong> each Tuesday in May (7th, 14th, 21st, 28th). Two cohorts in parallel, at different times of day. One is 10am-noon, the other is 5-7pm (in Pacific time: UTC−7).</p>

      <p><strong>How many people?</strong> It's capped at 15 per cohort.</p>

      <p><strong>How much is it?</strong> $200 USD.</p>

    <h3>Some principles of graceful mating dancing</h3>
    <p>Here are some principles I’ll be sharing, in writing, presentation, and when working with you directly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Falling in love is about answering a question: are we a fit?</strong>—and not just a fit for the short-term, but for raising kids and growing old together. That question is more important than making the relationship succeed in any particular way. If you try to make the relationship become something in particular, but it doesn’t want to be, you’re inviting a world of suffering.</li>
      <li><strong>A healthy relationship means that both of you feel like enough, the whole time.</strong> If you don’t feel like enough for the other person, or you feel like they’re not enough for you, then back up until you both feel like enough. It’s not that you can’t challenge each other, but you don’t want to be feeling like every day you’re failing to live up to who the other person <em>already</em> expects you to be.</li>
      <li><strong>You’re not supposed to be sober.</strong> It’s called “falling in love” because you’re not totally in control. But you don’t have to fall <em>madly</em> in love!</li>
      <li><strong>Let every concern step onto the scale.</strong> Every concern is a potential dealbreaker, but this is fine because if it’s a fit then none of them are <em>actual</em> dealbreakers. But if you don't let them have a say at all, you undermine your inner consensus process.</li>
      <li><strong>Committing while you’re worried if you’re settling is called… settling.</strong> You don’t get to know everything in advance. You <em>do</em> get to know if you’ve resolved your worries to your satisfaction at the point when you commit, or if you’re pushing past them.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidently mating for life requires the possibility of heartbreak:</strong>  opening to the possibility that you’ll experience the powerless pain of having them reject you, or that you’ll have to make the gutwrenching decision to reject someone you love dearly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

    <p>(this is my first time running the course, but in the meantime here's a quote from Visa that's not specific to the "falling in love" part of mating dances per se but is relevant)</p>

    <blockquote>I’ve had Malcolm sit in for me as a mediator in a conflict in an important personal relationship, helping me and my partner see each other’s perspectives better, trust each other better, relate to each other better, in a way that I think made a permanent positive difference. It’s not inaccurate to describe Malcolm as a “trust doctor”, and he approaches it in a very ecological way, rather than mechanically going through a checklist.<br><br>&mdash;Visakan Veerasamy</blockquote>

    <h2>Questions & Answers</h2>
    
    <h3>Can me and my partner both sign up?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely! Let me know, if you do.</p>
      <p>Also if you’re stoked about this approach and they aren’t, that's some evidence you’re not a fit. Not that they have to want to sign up for my course in order for it to be a good match&mdash;that'd be a silly thing to say. But if you’re like “yes! I want to do this backing up in order to stay enough” thing and they’re like “that's not how relationships work”, you may find yourself having to say “well, it seems to me that I want my relationships to work like that.”</p>

    <h3>Is this relevant if I’m polyamorous?</h3>
      <p>Yes, especially if you’re looking for someone to have kids with. Mating dancing is involved in any process of getting clarity on whether to make a big commitment. If you plan to relationship anarchy your whole life then this is not the course for you.</p>

    <h3>Is this relevant if I’m queer?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. I have one or two general notions about ways in which male & female mating dances tend to differ in the context of straight couples, but those are very minor points and not central to what the course is about. Again: I'm here to help you listen to your own sense of how your dance is going, not tell you how it's supposed to go.</p>

    <h3>Can I get a refund if I don't like it?</h3>
      <p>
        Of course! (within 30 days)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not literally "no questions asked", because I would ask you to share why it wasn't a fit so that I can learn. But whatever the reason, I don't want your money if you don't feel you got what you paid for.
      </p>
    
    <h3>What's your story? Why would I listen to you?</h3>
      <p>Here are three elements of my background that lead me to feel like I've got things worth saying on the topic of courtship.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I had a committed relationship where we tried really hard but it turns out the foundations were bad and we were just a bad fit for each other, but we convinced ourselves to commit anyway. This is what I call “falling madly in love”. We thought it was sane at the time, but in retrospect we overlooked some really key stuff about compatibility and about our process for checking for compatibility that would have been obvious if pointed out by a friend (or a course like this one). I’ve also noticed subtler versions of the same structures in other relationships, including non-romantic ones.</li>
        <li>I’m now in an amazing relationship that feels beautiful and simple and has sustained its sense of sanity through a lot more rigorous testing. Part of why this relationship is amazing is because we’re a much better fit, but I also credit its amazingness to us both taking a sane approach to falling in love, based on previous messes we’ve each gone through. It’s this wisdom I’m hoping to share with you here, so that you can learn from my mistakes rather than spending so many years making your own.</li>
        <li>I have spent a <em>lot</em> of time staring at trust in general, and how it gets built and ways in which fake trust sometimes gets built instead which ends up resulting in trust breakdowns which could have been avoided if people weren’t building fake trust in the first place. Falling in love is a central case of a domain where almost everybody is looking for deep robust embodied trust at least to some degree.</li>
      </ol>
